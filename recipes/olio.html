        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 

            <ul> 
                <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li> 
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
                <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li> 
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol> 
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
                
                <li>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>

                <li>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</li>

                <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
            </ol>
